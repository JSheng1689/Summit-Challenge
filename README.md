Build web app using Yelp Fusion API for Capital One

This was my first time building a website that utilized an API. I incorporated HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask frameworks, and AJAX. This website queries the user for a category, location, and number of results, and returns information about nearby relevant shops and displays the user's location along with the shops' locations on the map. I hope to add more onto this project, including sorting by price, rating, etc. and learn more front end design to make it more visually appealing. Overall, it was a really fun learning experience and I'm proud of the progress I made with this project.
